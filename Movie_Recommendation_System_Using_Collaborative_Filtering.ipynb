        "In this project, we developed a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering, a popular technique used for providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. By utilizing both **view count** and **average ratings** as key factors, we generated a list of movie recommendations to help users discover movies they are likely to enjoy. This approach leverages the power of data mining and machine learning techniques to provide an efficient, data-driven method for content recommendation. The implementation of this recommendation system is carried out in Python, using a dataset containing movie ratings and metadata.\n",

        "In today’s digital world, the sheer volume of content available to users makes it difficult to discover new and relevant movies. Personalized recommendations help users find content that matches their interests and preferences. Collaborative filtering is a well-known technique in the field of recommendation systems, where the system suggests items based on the preferences of similar users.\n",

        " **2. Problem Statement**\n",
        "\n",
        "With the increasing number of movies available on streaming platforms, users often struggle to find relevant content that fits their tastes. Traditional search methods may fail to provide personalized suggestions based on individual preferences. Thus, there is a need for a system that can effectively recommend movies based on collaborative filtering using both view count and ratings.\n",

        "In collaborative filtering, the idea is to recommend movies based on the preferences of users who have shown interest in similar movies. We use **user-based collaborative filtering**, which involves finding users who have watched the same movie as the input movie and recommending movies that these users have also watched.\n",

        "**Key Concept**:\n",
        "- **View Count**: The number of users who watched a particular movie.\n",
        "- **Average Rating**: The average rating given by all users who watched the movie.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then combine these two metrics into a **weighted score**, where we give higher priority to movies with a high rating and more viewers.\n",

        "5.3 Calculation of Weighted Score\n",
        "\n",
        "To calculate the weighted score for each movie, we use the following formula:\n",

        "***Weighted Score=(Average Rating×Rating Weight) + (Watch Count×View Count Weight)***\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the implementation, we use the following weights:\n",
        "- **Rating Weight**: 0.7 (importance given to the rating).\n",
        "- **View Count Weight**: 0.3 (importance given to the number of users who watched the movie).\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining these two factors, the system generates a **top N recommendations** based on the highest weighted scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.4 Recommendation Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "The recommendations are generated by filtering out the input movie and then selecting the movies that were watched by users who also watched the input movie. The movies are then ranked based on their weighted score.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "movie_stats['weighted_score'] = movie_stats['avg_rating'] * 0.7 + movie_stats['watch_count'] * 0.3\n",
